Although initially thought to have originated as an artificial variant of an extant canid species (variously supposed as being the dhole, golden jackal, or gray wolf), extensive genetic studies undertaken during the 2010s indicate that dogs diverged from an extinct wolf-like canid in Eurasia 40,000 years ago. Their long association with humans has led to dogs being uniquely attuned to human behavior and are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet which would be inadequate for other canid species. Dogs are also the oldest domesticated animal. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colours. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet, "man\'s best friend".', 'title': 'Dog', 'url': 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dog'}, {'image': 'http://placehold.it/350x150', 'description': 'Einer frisst den anderen (released as Dog Eat Dog!, in the United States) is a 1964 German crime drama film that starred Jayne Mansfield, Cameron Mitchell, Dodie Heath, Ivor Salter, Isa Miranda, Elisabeth Flickenschildt, Werner Peters, and Pinkas Braun.

Hot dog preparation and condiment styles vary regionally in the US. Although linked in particular with New York City and New York City cuisine, the hot dog became ubiquitous throughout the United States during the 20th century, becoming an important part of other regional cuisines, most notably Chicago street cuisine.
